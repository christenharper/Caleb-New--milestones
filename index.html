</html><p style="color:rgb(77, 6, 136);">1810   Babbage had a vision of mechanically computing numbers and tables. Lovelace began working with Charles Babbage as an assistant while Babbage was working on his “Analytical Engine” the first mechanical computer</p>
</html><p style="color:rgba(255, 64, 30, 0.842);">1948    University of Manchester researchers Frederic Williams, Tom Kilburn, and Geoff Toothill develop the Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), better known as the Manchester "Baby." The Baby was built to test a new memory technology developed by Williams and Kilburn ,also known as the Williams Tube, which was the first high-speed electronic random access memory for computers. Their first program, consisting of seventeen instructions and written by Kilburn, ran on June 21st, 1948. This was the first program in history to run on a digital, electronic, stored-program computer.</p>
